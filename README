It contains four directories that are described below:
1. problem_details:
    
    We have used 6 programming problems in our experiments. A subdirectory is created for each problem in this directory. Each subdirectory contains:

        a. The problem statement in the file _statement.txt

        b. Testcases containing an input in file inputx.txt and the corresponding output in file outputx.txt

        c. A reference solution in the file solution.c.
2. filters:

    The 6 subdirectories contains 7 filters as described in the paper.

        a. kEL represents solutions that contain k error lines and pass atleast 1 testcase. It contains subdirectories naming from submission_1 to submission_j and each submission directory contains a pair of correct and incorrect solution. The difference between correct and incorrect solutions is of k lines. To find the difference between two solutions, we have used an external tool named Clara. In the pair, a correct solution by a student X is selected for an incorrect solution by the same student. If no such correct solution by the student X is available, then we compare the incorrect solution by the reference solution.

        b. The solutions in 2FT fails one or two testcases.

        c. LIS contains the last incorrect solution by a student and pass atleast 1 testcase.

        d. 2FT_intersect_LIS_intersect_kEL contains solutions that come in the intersection of 2FT, LIS, and kEL.

        e. passing_atleast_1_test_but_not_all contains solutions that are incorrect but do not fail all test cases.

        f. incorrect_solutions is a superset of previous one. It contains solutions that can fail all the test cases.

    If a subdirectory is missing any of the above described filters, then it represents that no solution fall into that filter.
3. additional_filters:

    It contains subdirectories for various combinations of individual filters 2FT, kEL and LIS.

4. refute_questions:

    It contains the solutions that we have selected from different filters and used them in user study.
