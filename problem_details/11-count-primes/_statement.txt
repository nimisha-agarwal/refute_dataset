Given a positive integer N, count the number of unique positive integer pairs {p1,p2} such that:
0<= p1 <= N
0<= p2 <= N
p1 + 2 = p2
p1 and p2 are primes

e.g.
Input: 11
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two twin prime pairs below 11: {3,5} and {5,7}

Input: 19
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four twin prime pairs below 19: {3,5}, {5,7}, {11,13} and {17,19}
